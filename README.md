## Introduction
 eGFR-CKD-EPI calculator is a Python program that calculates the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The eGFR is a measure of kidney function and is used to assess the stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This calculator provides an easy way to estimate eGFR based on age, gender, serum creatinine level, and race.

## Explanation
The eGFR is an important clinical parameter used by healthcare professionals to evaluate kidney function. It estimates the rate at which the kidneys filter waste products from the blood. The CKD-EPI equation is a widely accepted method for calculating eGFR as it provides more accurate results compared to previous equations.

The CKD-EPI equation takes into account factors such as age, gender, serum creatinine level, and race to estimate eGFR. The equation uses different coefficients and constants depending on the gender and race of the individual. By inputting these parameters into the calculator, you can obtain an estimated eGFR value.

## Usage
To use the eGFR-CKD-EPI calculator, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org).

2. Clone the Repository: Clone the eGFR-CKD-EPI repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mreghbal/eGFR-CKD-EPI.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the Directory: Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd eGFR-CKD-EPI
   ```

4. Run the Program: Execute the Python script by running the following command:
   ```
   python egfr_calculator.py
   ```

5. Enter Input Values: The program will prompt you to enter the required input values:
   - Age: Enter your age in years.
   - Gender: Enter your gender either "male" "female".
   - Serum Creatinine Level: Enter your serum creatinine level in mg/dL.
   - Race: Enter your race as either "white" or "black".

6. View Results: After entering the input values, the program will calculate and display the estimated eGFR value.

7. Follow Medical Guidance: Please note that the eGFR value obtained from this calculator is an estimation and should not be used as a definitive diagnosis. It is important to consult with healthcare professionals for accurate interpretation of eGFR results and appropriate medical guidance.
