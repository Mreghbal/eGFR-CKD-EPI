# eGFR-CKD-EPI
The Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.
In this updated code, we modified the calculate_egfr function to use the CKD-EPI equation for eGFR calculation. The coefficients and constants specific to the CKD-EPI equation are implemented based on gender and race.

Please keep in mind that accurate interpretation of eGFR results and appropriate medical guidance should be obtained from healthcare professionals.
